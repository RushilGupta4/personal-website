  <p>The day I was coding till 5AM</p>
</div>

I embarked on this project with two primary goals in mind. First, I wanted to explore frontend development and enhance my existing skills. Secondly, I
aimed to master Next.js, a framework I'd been eager to explore thoroughly.

As I delved into the world of web development, I discovered an unexpected benefit of building my personal website - it became a platform to establish
and showcase my identity. It allowed me to share my passions and interesting parts of my life.

However, the most profound realization was that I first had to understand myself properly to accurately portray myself on the website. This led me on
a personal journey of self-exploration. I began reflecting on my values, passions, journey so far, expectations for the future, and what defines me.
This journey of self-discovery proved to be just as valuable, if not more, than the technical skills I was acquiring.

Developing my website became not only a project in web development but also a voyage of self-discovery. It enabled me to represent my true self and
connect with others who share my interests and values. The effects were evident, too - I felt more connected with myself when talking to others and
had a clearer mind than before.

I'm proud of my website and even more grateful for the personal growth it has sparked. It's a testament to the power of combining technical skills
with a deep understanding of oneself. I encourage everyone to embark on similar journeys - you never know what you might discover about yourself along
the way!

_PS: I hope I also developed my technical skills along the way T_T (Isn't this website nice?)_
