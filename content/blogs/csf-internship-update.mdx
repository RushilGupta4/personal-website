Two months ago, I wrote about my eagerness to land my first internship the enthusiasm of a bright-eyed freshman. While the initial hurdle of being
underage presented itself, it didn't dim my spirit. Instead, it fueled my determination, leading me to a collaboration that turned out to be an
unforgettable experience.

Today, as I reflect on the past two months, I am filled with a profound sense of gratitude. The internship journey began with a determined negotiation
and became a vibrant learning experience. Working alongside Jithu and the team, I had the opportunity to collaborate across four distinct teams and
contribute to three diverse projects.

Each day brought new challenges and exciting opportunities. I honed my skills, learned from experienced professionals, and discovered new facets of my
own potential. The highlight of this journey was undoubtedly the visit to their office. Stepping into the physical space where I had been virtually
interacting with the team for weeks, meeting them face-to-face, was a moment I will cherish forever.

This internship wasn't just about gaining professional experience; it was about building connections, forging friendships, and learning valuable life
lessons. It taught me the power of perseverance, the importance of adapting to unexpected situations, and the joy of collaborating with a supportive
and inspiring team.

As I step forward into the next chapter of my journey, I carry with me the knowledge, skills, and friendships acquired during this enriching
experience. I am incredibly grateful to Jithu and the entire team for believing in me and providing me with this incredible opportunity. This
internship will remain a cherished memory, a testament to the power of enthusiasm, determination, and the transformative power of genuine connections.
