### Enthusiastic Freshman: The Hunt For Opportunities

Picture this: I am a bright-eyed freshman, barely a month into university life, and my enthusiasm knows no bounds. Having joined many mailing lists
and WhatsApp groups, I eagerly seek internships, research opportunities, or any chance to be part of a club. Then, one fateful day, a notification
pops up - an internship opportunity.

### From Enthusiasm to Hurdles: The Interview

Without hesitation, I reach out to the recruiter, and to my astonishment, they schedule an interview for the same day. The interview goes surprisingly
well, and I am on my way to landing my first internship. That's when it happens - when my excitement meets with the brick wall of bureaucracy. It
turns out you need to be 18 to legally intern with them, and I am still in the "underage" club.

### The Struggle: Negotiations

Not one to give up easily, I tried to convince them to let me intern unpaid, thinking that might bypass the age barrier. But alas, my persuasive
skills were no match for the ironclad rules of the internship. The best I could wrangle was a polite letter of collaboration. It wasn't the outcome I
had envisioned, but it would be a valuable learning experience.

### The Outcome: The Lessons

This incident taught me some important lessons. Firstly, it showed me the importance of jumping at opportunities. After all, the worst they can say is
no. Secondly, it emphasized the need to carefully review eligibility criteria for opportunities. It also underlined the importance of adaptability in
the face of unexpected challenges.
