### The Community

The Ashokan community was very different from what I had expected. Entering the university with a perception of little inclusivity, I was surprised to
say the least.

Although there is a lot I could go on about, one thing stands out the most - the **4th Floor**, which I have been very lucky to be a part of. Everyone
interacts with everyone over here, building a warm and friendly community. Although we all stay up late till 4 AM in the pantry, we still figure out
how to squeeze in work.

### The Opportunities

Over the last 1 month, I was blasted with more opportunities than expected. Within the first week, I attended a session by Rahat Kulshreshtha on
'Serendipity', where I had the opportunity to interact with industry professionals and meet many YIFs.

Within another 2 weeks, I was lucky enough to be nominated for a lunch with Shveta Raina, the founder of Talerang. It was a unique experience where I
learned more than I can explain, not skills but character.

### The Lessons

- **Professor Simeon**: Before enrolling in the course, I was a typical STEM student - a mere utilitarian, only seeing utility in its physical
  aspects. Through his course, my mind has understood the importance of thought, and as Professor Simeon quoted, _'Everyone knows the usefulness of
  what is useful but few know the usefulness of what is useless'_.
- **Rahat Kulshreshtha**: Although only a small session, I was enlightened about serendipity. It taught me the importance of never turning down
  opportunities; you never know when you'll unexpectedly connect with someone.
- **Shveta Raina**: Besides her immense knowledge, her joyful character struck me the most. No matter how long it has been or what topic is being
  discussed, one thing remained constant - her smile and boundless enthusiasm. It was a profound lesson in the power of positivity and how it can
  shape the world around you.
